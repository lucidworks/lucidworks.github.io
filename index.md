Welcome to Lucidworks Playgrounds. 

Playgrounds offer an open learning environment designed to foster user discovery and exploration of our products through practical exercises, rather than rigid, guided workflows.

Each playground application comes equipped with user documentation detailing the app itself, the data sources it utilizes, suggested exploration paths, challenges to test your understanding, and links to additional resources.

Click the **Start** button to create a new playground application specifically for you, complete with a unique username and password.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You are in control!**
> 
> We prioritize user autonomy in Playgrounds, opting not to enforce strict workflows. This freedom allows for experimentation, potentially leading to scenarios that might break the application or cause unexpected behavior.
>
> If you need to reset your progress and start over, click the **Clear** button. Then click the **Start** button to create a new playground. 

Please note that your playground application has a runtime of approximately 60 minutes, after which it will be automatically deleted.
