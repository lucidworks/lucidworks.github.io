Welcome to Lucidworks Playgrounds. 

Playgrounds provide an open learning experience focused on hands-on user discovery and exploration of Lucidworks products instead of strict, guided workflows. 

Each playground app includes user documentation, which provides information about the app, the data sources, things to try, challenges, and additional resources.

When you click the Start button, a new playground app, as well as a unique username and password, is created specifically for you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You are in control!**
> 
> To give you the freedom to explore, we don't enforce strict workflows in playgrounds. That means you might do something that breaks your application or cause it to work in unexpected ways. 
>
> If you need to reset your progress and start over, click the **Clear** button. Then click the **Start** button to create a new playground. 

You have approximately 60 minutes to use your playground app. After that, the app is deleted.
