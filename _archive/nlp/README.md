# Start your environment by clicking **Start Lab** above. 

## The environment should begin to load immediately. Please do not click *Start Lab* again. It may take a few minutes for the Fusion environment to fully display.

# Welcome to the Natural Language Processing Lab. In this lab  you will learn how to use deploy a spaCy model, create a machine learning job, and add fields to the Query Workbench. Let's get started!


> Note: You may need to adjust the size of the instructions panel to fully view results in the UI. Toggle the window sizes as needed.

1. Click on the app **Labs** to enter the *Fusion workspace*

2. Hover over the COLLECTIONS icon and click **Jobs**

3. Click  **Add+**

4. Begin typing “create seldon” and select **Create Seldon Core Model Deployment** from the dropdown

5. In the Create Seldon Core Model Deployment window enter the following info for the fields shown below:

    a. JOB ID: ```Labs-spacy```

    b. MODEL NAME: ```spacy```

    c. DOCKER REPOSITORY: ```lucidworks```

    d. IMAGE NAME: ```spacy-seldon:v1.0```

    e. OUTPUT COLUMN NAMES FOR MODEL: <br>
    ```[token_offsets, pos_labels, ner_offsets, ner_labels, lemma_offsets, sentence_offsets]```

<br>

6. Click **Save**

7. Click **Run**, then click **Start**

>Note: Success! The job will take about a minute, when it's done, the "running" icon will change to a "sunshine". 

8. Click **Save** in the Run Job window

9. Hover over the INDEXING icon and click **Index Pipelines**

10. Click the **Add+** button

11. For **Pipeline ID**, enter ```labs-spacy```

12. Click **Add a new pipeline stage**

13. Begin typing "machine" and select **Machine Learning** from the dropdown

14. In the Machine Learning window enter the following info for the fields shown below:

    a. Label: ```Extract Entities```

    b. Model ID: select **spacy** from the dropdown

15. Click into the field for **Model input transformation script**

16. Scroll to line 46 of the code. Cut and paste the ```*/``` before line 42, as shown below:

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/fusion-datasets/5.4_Markdown_images/NLP/2_6.png" style="height: 85px; width:600px;"/>

<br>

>Note: This will "comment out" everything before line 42, making it inactive

17. Replace line 44 of the script with the following:


`modelInput.put("input", doc.getFieldValues("longDescription"))`


Your script should resemble the image below:

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/fusion-datasets/5.4_Markdown_images/NLP/2_7.png" style="height: 569px; width:600px;"/>

<br>

18. Once you are finished modifying the script, close the script window

19. Returning to the Machine Learning window, click into the field for **Model output transformation script**

20. Scroll to line 16 of the code. Cut and paste the ```*/``` before line 14, as shown below:

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/fusion-datasets/5.4_Markdown_images/NLP/3.png" style="height: 126px; width:600px;"/>

<br>

21. Remove the existing text after the ```*/```, and replace it with the following code:


<p>doc.addField("ner_labels_ss", modelOutput.get("ner_labels"))<br>
doc.addField("ner_offsets_ss", modelOutput.get("ner_offsets"))<br>
doc.addField("pos_offsets_ss", modelOutput.get("pos_offsets"))<br>
doc.addField("pos_labels_ss", modelOutput.get("pos_labels"))<br>
doc.addField("lemma_offsets_ss", modelOutput.get("lemma_offsets"))<br>
doc.addField("sentence_offsets_ss", modelOutput.get("sentence_offsets"))

<br>

>Note: This is how we will create new fields to appear in the Query Workbench!

<br>

22. Your Model output transformaton script should now resemble the following:

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/fusion-datasets/5.4_Markdown_images/NLP/4_5.png" style="height: 313px; width:600px;"/>

<br>

23. Once you are finished modifying the script, close the script window

24. Click the **Save** button in the upper right corner of the Machine Learning Pipeline window

25. Hover over the COLLECTIONS icon and click **Jobs**

26. Click the job **BestBuy_catalog**

27. Under the READ OPTIONS section, in the SEND TO INDEX PIPELINE field, enter ```labs-spacy```

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/fusion-datasets/5.4_Markdown_images/NLP/5.png" style="height: 337px; width:600px;"/>

<br>

28. Click the **Save** button. Then, click **Run**, and **Start**. 

    a. *Note that this particular job could take up to 15 minutes due to the constraints of the lab environment. Fortunately we only need to wait for 3 to 5 minutes before we start seeing results.

29. Please wait for 3 to 5 minutes and then hover over QUERYING and click **Query Workbench**

30. Under the first result, click **show fields**

31. When we scroll down a little, we can now see the fields we added in the Index Pipeline

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/fusion-datasets/5.4_Markdown_images/NLP/6.png" style="height: 300px; width:600px;"/>

<br>

Now, let's add some field facets using our new fields

32. In the Query Workbench window, click **Add a field facet**

33. Begin typing "pos" and select **pos_labels_ss**

The field facet then shows the different parts-of-speech labels that are in the long descriptions of each product

<br>

34. Click **Add a field facet** again, and begin typing "lemma". Select **lemma_offsets_ss**

This field facet organizes when, and how many times, a person, quantity, organization, time (and much more) are mentioned in the long descriptions of each product
