## The environment should begin to load immediately. Please do not click *Start Lab* again. It may take a few minutes for the Fusion environment to fully display.

When the Fusion Login page displays, login:
* USERNAME: ```admin```
* PASSWORD: ```password123```

## In this lab  you will set up clustering, evaluate results, and tune the clustering job! Let's get started by setting up clustering
 
1. Click on the app **Labs** to enter the *Fusion workspace*, this is where you can build and test document clustering. Before proceeding with the lab, please make your way to the JOBS tab under COLLECTIONS located on the side menu. Make sure that both the BestBuy_catalog and BestBuy_signals_labs jobs have run. If you see a caution sign, please run that job again before attempting to go any further.

# Setting up Clustering

2. Hover over the **COLLECTIONS** icon in the sidebar, then click **Jobs**

3. Click **Add**, then select **Document Clustering**

4. Toggle on **Advanced**. Let's add some parameters:
    * Change the **Spark Job ID** to ``product_clustering``
    * Update the **Training Collection** to ``Labs``
    * Update the **Output Collection** to ``Labs``
    * Find **Training Data Sampling Fraction** and input ``0.2``
    * Update the **Field to Vectorize** to ``longDescription``

5. Click **Save**, then **Run**, then **Start**

>Note: Success! The job will take about a minute, when it's done, the "running" icon will change to a "sunshine". 

# Evaluating Results

6. Hover over the **QUERYING** icon in the sidebar, then click **Query Workbench**

7. Click **Add a field facet** and select **cluster_label**

8. Click **Add a field facet** and select **freq_terms**

9. Click **View next 10** under the **cluster_label** facet

>Note: The cluster_label field contains the five terms that best define the center of each cluster.  The freq_terms field contains the five terms that appear most often in each cluster.  You will note that, in many cases, the frequent terms in a cluster are also among those those that best define it. The clustering job also identified and labeled oddball documents: abnormally long ones, those too short to determine anything meaningful, and those that do not seem closely related to any of the big clusters.

# Tuning the Clustering Job

10. Hover over the **COLLECTIONS** icon in the sidebar, then click **Collections Manager**

11. Click **New**, and name your new collection **Labs2**.

12. Toggle on **Advanced** and uncheck **Enable Signals**. Click **Save Collection**

13. Hover over the **COLLECTIONS** icon in the sidebar, then click **Jobs**

14. Select the **product_clustering** job and toggle on **Advanced**

15. Modify the following parameters:
    * Change the **Output Collection** to ``Labs2``
    * Update the **Outlier Cutoff** to ``0.02``
    * Update the **Min Possible Number of Clusters** to ``5``
    * Update the **Max Possible Number of Clusters** to ``25``
    * Update the **Word2Vec Dimension** to ``100``
  
16. Click **Save**, then **Run**, then **Start**

>Note: Success! The job will take about a minute, when it's done, the "running" icon will change to a "sunshine". 

17. Click the **Collections** dropdown and select the output collection **Labs2**

18. Hover over the **QUERYING** icon in the sidebar, then click **Query Workbench**

19. Click **Add a field facet** and select **cluster_label**

20. Click **Add a field facet** and select **freq_terms**

>Note: Explore your clusters. Do they look better than they did previously?

21. Make sure to **Save** your open Fusion Workspace tabs!

________
Great job! You now have functioning document clustering in your Fusion instance! If you would like to save your Fusion App to reference later, you can do it now:
1. Return to the Fusion Launcher
2. Hover over your app and click on the cog that appears in the lower right corner
3. Within the box that opens, click **Export app to zip**

This concludes the Document Clustering Lab.
