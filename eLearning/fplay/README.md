# Welcome to the Fusion Playground. This is an interactive space where you can get hands-on experience with Fusion. Here you'll have an unlimited number of 60-minute sessions to explore what Fusion has to offer. 

## Start your environment by clicking **Start Lab** above. The environment should begin to load immediately as indicated by the Vocareum loading symbol. When the Fusion Login page opens, login:
* USERNAME: ```admin```
* PASSWORD: ```password123```

1. To begin, either click **Create new app** or **Import app** if you have an application that you have exported

2. Explore Fusion, but remember, you only have 60 minutes before the session is terminated

>Make sure to **Save** your open Fusion Workspace tabs when you're finished!

2. Hover over your app, a cog will appear in the lower right corner, click it
3. On the box that opens, click **Export app to zip**
