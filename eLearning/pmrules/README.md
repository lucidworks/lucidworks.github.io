## Welcome to the Predictive Merchandiser Rules Lab! <br> Through this set of lab activities, you will practice creating and managing rules using Predictive Merchandiser.

---
<br>

In this lab, you will be following a real scenario to:
* Create a rule (broken down into three steps, which will focus on the columns and the information they contain).
* Publish a rule.

<br>

Different from our other labs, we encourage you to try the exercise first, then check to see how you did. If you get stuck, we have provided the following to keep you moving:
* **Hints** provide helpful clues regarding the appropriate task to perform.
* **Solution Steps** walk you through step by step instructions, detailing how to complete the task.

## Rules Manager Dashboard

For this lab, we will be selecting the **Electronics** app that has already been configured for our lab environment. We are going to start by opening the app in Fusion, then navigating to the **Rules Manager** dashboard.

1. On the Fusion launch page, click the **Electronics** app to open it and enter the Fusion workspace. 

2. In the left navigation pane, click **Relevance**, then select **Rules** from the list.

>Clicking **Rules** will open the **Rules Manager** in a new tab in your browser.

## Creating Rules

Our first exercise will be creating a new rule using the following scenario:

The holiday season is approaching and you need to visit your Rules Manager Dashboard in order to **add a rule for the annual seasonal sale**. Every year, your company pins the most popular items based on trends from top influencers on social media. 

What do you click to begin?

## Rule General Information

Now that we have the rule shell started, let's break it down and start with the General column first. 

Per the company standard, **the rule is always called *Product Group* - Annual Holiday Sale**.  Based on recommendations from the top influencers on social media, the product group just so happens to be **Wireless Headphones**. 

Additionally, **youâ€™ll want to add the description *Surplus wireless headphones Winter Holiday Sale Nov. - Dec. Four products pinned*** to differentiate the rule from others so that you can easily identify what the rule depicts without clicking into it. 

Company policy does not require you to fill out any additional information in the General column. 

How would you fill out the general rule information using these details?

<details>

<summary>Hint</summary> 

* Name the rule *Wireless Headphones - Annual Holiday Sale*.  

* Enter the rule description of *Surplus wireless headphones Winter Holiday Sale Nov. - Dec. Four products pinned*.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Solution Steps</summary> 

4. In the General section, enter the following values:
* In the **Name** field, enter ```Wireless Headphones - Annual Holiday Sale```. 
* In the **Description** field, enter ```Surplus wireless headphones Winter Holiday Sale Nov. - Dec. Four products pinned```.
* Leave the remaining fields blank.

## Rule Conditions

Next, let's look at the Condition column for this rule. 

In order for this sale to be successful, you know that **whenever a customer searches the keyword Headphones**, specific products should be pinned to the first four spaces on the Merchandiser Dashboard. 

Additionally, **this sale runs from November 1st through December 24th** of this year. 

How would you fill out the rule conditions using this information? 

<details>

<summary>Hint</summary> 

* Condition Types should be set to Query AND Dates.  

* Match Query Using should be set to Keywords, and Search terms should be set to headphones.  

* Dates should reflect Nov. 1 - Dec. 24.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Solution Steps</summary> 

5. In the **Condition Types** field, click the dropdown arrow and select both the ```Query``` and ```Date``` options.  

6. Click in the **Dates** field and select the following values:
* For the beginning date, select ```November 1``` of this year, and the starting time of ```12:00```.
* For the ending date, select ```December 24```  of this year, and the starting time of ```12:00```.

7. In the **Match Query Using** field, click the dropdown arrow and select the ```Keywords``` option (if it is not already selected).

## Rule Actions

Last, let's visit the Action column. 

In the Action column, you know that **specifc products will be pinned based on their product IDs**. 

You have your product IDs ready to pin in the following positions: <br>
1. First - 3857133<br>
2. Second - 3730573<br>
3. Third - 5414492<br>
4. Fourth - 4564402

How would you use this information to fill out the Action column?

<details>

<summary>Hint</summary> 

* Action should be set to Pinned.  

* Field Name should be set to id.  

* Pinned documents should list the above ID numbers in the order listed.  

* Positions for each product ID should correspond to the number they are listed with above.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Solution Steps</summary> 

9. In the **Action Type** field, click the dropdown arrow and select **Pinned** from the list.  

10. Leave the **Set Response Values** field empty.  

11. In the **Field Name** field, enter ```id``` (if it is not already entered).  

12. In the Pinned Documents section, click **+ADD** four times to generate four **Value** fields.  

13. For each of the **Value** fields, enter each value and position number as listed:
* ```3857133```, with position ```1```
* ```3730573```, with position ```2```
* ```5414492```, with position ```3```

## Publishing

You want this rule to automatically display starting  November 1st, and already have approval from your department to make this happen. 

In order for the rule to take effect once the condition criteria are both met, **you'll need to publish the rule**. 

How can you do that?

<details>

<summary>Hint</summary> 

* Publish the new rule you have created.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Solution Steps</summary> 

15. Hover your mouse over the **Published** column for the new rule.  

16. Click **Publish Individual Rule**.  

17. In the Publish dialog, click **Publish** to confirm the action.  

Your page will refresh to indicate the rule has been published.
